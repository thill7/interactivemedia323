var Text = "Wershler-Henry has often remarked in conversation that, for poetry, the webpage represents the first, truly new, unit of typographic composition since the invention of the page itself. While lyricists, inspired by Olson,might portray the page as a blank slate for their own proprioceptive investigations, a new era of poetry has begun to suggest that the web page may provide the first, truly synaesthetic 'composition by field,' in which the page no longer offers a passive terrain for the exploration of a lyrical thought because now the page itself can interact both dynamically and sensorially with the poet, engaging every sense at once in an immersive experience beyond the limited purview of the word. While designers,employed by Yahoo, may build a web page so that it merely acts as yet another medium for the delivery of printed, textual information, a small cadre of technically adept poets has begun to experiment with the aesthetic potential of this exciting, literary resource. Since poetry has virtually exhausted the exploration of its own aesthetic formalism, any subsequent innovation in poetry seems unlikely to occur without a concomitant deformation of the tools used, not only in composition, but also in publication. The poetry of the future may have to explode the formal limits of the book, finding a new way to disrupt the stratified sequencing of the page, doing so, by actively engaging the experimental technologies of cybernetic publishing. I draw particular attention to one website by James Tindall in order to suggest, tentatively, that such an endeavour may represent a kind of workshop for a hypothetic literature of the future.";

	<h2>Letter by letter, with Pixabay API</h2>
	<p>This method of posting was logistically difficult, but I feel like it worked at least 80% as intended. It's hard to see what's going on behind the scenes, but the text has been stored as a variable in this page. For each letter of each word, an image search for that letter is made and then added to the page. Since a search is made for each letter, the results should be unique each time the page is loaded.</p>
	<p>I chose to do this in order to emphasize a point touched on in the text illustrated: webpages can be a medium for dynamic poetry, however loosely poetry may be defined in this context. As Bok argues, any novel development in poetry is unlikely to occure unless the tools used are reevaluated.</p>

		<h2>Reddit, JSON, and Imgur</h2>
		<p>This one, I'll admit, became a lot more covoluted than originally intended. First, I created a subreddit: /r/thesquarerootofnegative1. Then I made a post with the first line of the text, followed by a chain of replies with two separate accounts until the entirety was spelled out. But what you're seeing here isn't that post, but rather all of the information about those posts as its seen by the servers, in a format known as JSON (Javascript Object Notation): basically, lists of lists. This kind of data has numerous applications, and was actually used to create the little applet on my homepage, which loads random images from different subreddits. My purpose in this one is a little more abstract. I wanted to try to show the layers of a webpage that aren't usually visible. The rigging that makes the webpage as a medium truly unique.</p>
